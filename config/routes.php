 *
 * - Route
 * - InflectedRoute
 * - DashedRoute

 * If no call is made to `Router::defaultRouteClass()`, the class used is

 * Note that `Route` does not do any inflections on URLs which will result in
 * inconsistently cased URLs when used with `:plugin`, `:controller` and
 * `:action` markers.
